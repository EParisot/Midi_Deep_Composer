## Data:
For each track, for each note, chord or rest, we used the pitch, duration, offset and velocity as "one-hot encoded" values.

We generate a note/chord or rest based on the seq_len (32) last notes/chords or rests. 
Long chunks of music are generated by sliding the window over time.

[A3, C5, [C2, E2, A2], rest, ...] == (seq_len notes) -> prediction -> predicted note
